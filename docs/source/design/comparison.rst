Comparison to Other Tools
=========================

There are several excellent open-source tools for robot motion planning, each with its own design philosophy.
This page compares RoboPlan to the most common alternatives so you can pick the right tool for your application.

As described in the :doc:`Design Philosophy </design/philosophy>`, RoboPlan differs from most frameworks in three ways:

- **Not a monolith**: Concrete, shared data types instead of abstract plugin interfaces. Swapping components means changing code, not YAML.
- **Middleware is optional**: The core library is standalone; ROS 2 wrappers live in the separate `roboplan-ros <https://github.com/open-planning/roboplan-ros>`_ repository.
- **Bindings are top priority**: Core algorithms are implemented in C++ and ship with typed Python bindings, installable via ``pip`` and ``conda``.

.. note::

   This comparison reflects the state of each project at the time of writing.
   All of these tools are actively developed, so check their documentation for the latest details.
   If you see anything that is incorrect or missing, please submit an issue or pull request.

Which Tool Should You Use?
--------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :class: comparison-table
   :widths: 12 44 44

   * - Tool
     - Choose it when...
     - Keep in mind...
   * - **RoboPlan**
     - You want a lean, code-first library for manipulator IK, planning, and trajectory generation that works in C++ or Python, with or without ROS.
     - Pre-1.0 with breaking changes and an intentionally small algorithm surface; no optimization-based planners, perception pipeline, or online execution layer (yet!).
   * - MoveIt 2
     - You are building a ROS 2 system and want a batteries-included stack: GUI setup, perception, execution, and swappable planner/IK plugins without recompiling.
     - Requires ROS 2. Behavior is spread across many YAML/SRDF/launch files, and the abstract plugin interfaces can make debugging and customization harder. Open-source features and maintenance have slowed recently.
   * - Tesseract
     - You target industrial Cartesian processes (welding, painting, machining) that need mixed freespace/Cartesian programs, TrajOpt, and continuous collision checking — with Python bindings and optional ROS integration, like RoboPlan.
     - Pre-1.0 with breaking changes. Shares MoveIt's plugin/YAML indirection (by design), and the Python bindings are low-level SWIG wrappers.
   * - OMPL
     - You need a battle-tested catalog of sampling-based planners, constrained planning on manifolds, or planner benchmarking tools.
     - It is an algorithms library, not a framework: you (or a framework like MoveIt or Tesseract) must supply the robot model, collision checking, and trajectory timing.
   * - Drake
     - You want optimization-first planning (trajectory optimization, Graphs of Convex Sets) and high-fidelity dynamics with analytical gradients.
     - Steep learning curve; its planning tools are building blocks you compose yourself, not an end-to-end manipulation stack.
   * - cuRobo
     - You need very fast, batched motion generation and IK for learning pipelines or data generation, and have NVIDIA hardware.
     - Hard CUDA dependency with no CPU fallback; each robot needs a curated collision-sphere configuration.

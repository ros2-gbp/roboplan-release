System Architecture
===================

RoboPlan is organized as a set of packages around a common core.
The core package defines the :doc:`standard data types </design/philosophy>` (e.g., joint information, paths, trajectories) and the ``Scene``, which represents the robot and its environment.
Each algorithm lives in its own package, consumes the ``Scene`` and the standard types, and can be installed and used independently.

The diagram below shows the major components, the external libraries they build on, and how the Python bindings fit in.

Packages

Each C++ package ships its own Python bindings, exposed as a submodule of the ``roboplan`` namespace package.

The core package
----------------

The ``Scene`` is the central object in RoboPlan.
It owns the Pinocchio robot model and data, the collision geometry model, and planning-relevant information such as joint groups, joint limits, and dynamic obstacles.
On top of these it provides the queries every algorithm needs: forward kinematics, frame Jacobians, joint limits and groups, collision and distance checks, random and collision-free sampling, and interpolation/integration that respects the configuration space topology.

A ``Scene`` is constructed from a ``PinocchioSceneDescription`` (a Pinocchio model and its collision geometry).
Loaders produce that description; they are the only place format-specific I/O lives:

- ``loadUrdfSceneDescription`` / ``loadUrdfSceneDescriptionFromXml`` — URDF, with ``package_paths`` used to resolve ``package://`` meshes
- ``loadMjcfModel`` — MJCF
- ``loadJointLimitsConfig`` — joint-limit config, applied afterwards with ``importJointLimitsFromConfig``

The constructor is kinematics and geometry only.
Joint groups and disabled collision pairs are applied afterwards with ``importSrdf`` (SRDF XML contents) or the ``addGroup*`` / collision-pair helpers.

Algorithms take a ``Scene`` (usually as a ``std::shared_ptr``) and work with the standard data types, though they can also extract the underlying Pinocchio model information directly from the scene as necessary.
Following the design of Pinocchio, the ``Scene`` itself splits into:

- An immutable robot description (the model, the collision geometry, the frame/joint/group lookups)
- Per-query scratch (Pinocchio data, geometry data, the broadphase AABB tree, the RNG, the current configuration).

Only the first half is safe to share, so algorithms can snapshot a private ``SceneContext`` from the ``Scene`` and run every scratch-writing query (e.g., collision checks, forward kinematics, frame Jacobians, random sampling) against that.
Give each thread its own ``SceneContext`` and any number of algorithms can work against one shared ``Scene`` concurrently; the Python bindings release the GIL for the long-running entry points, so this holds from Python too.
A context also takes advantage of Pinocchio's broadphase manager for faster collision checking.

A ``SceneContext`` carries the configuration an algorithm is working at, which is what keeps that configuration from travelling between subsystems through the shared ``Scene``.
``Scene::setJointPositions`` and ``Scene::getCurrentJointPositions`` remain for interactive and scripting use; library code reads the current positions at most once, on entry to a call, to seed a context.

A context borrows the scene's collision geometry and sizes its own scratch from it when built.
Adding or removing geometry, or changing collision pairs, leaves that scratch stale: the collision queries report the mismatch rather than answering against geometry they were not sized for, while kinematics and sampling are unaffected.
Algorithms can build a context per call to pick up the change automatically, or hold one for their lifetime and refresh it as needed.
Moving an existing geometry with ``updateGeometryPlacement`` does not invalidate anything.

The core package also provides post-processing utilities that operate on paths, such as :doc:`path shortcutting </concepts/path_shortcutting>` and uniform resampling.


Algorithm packages
------------------

Each algorithm package builds on the core package, bringing in its own external solver where needed:

- **SimpleIK** iterates a damped least-squares update using Jacobians from the ``Scene``.
- **OInK** formulates IK as a quadratic program over tasks, constraints, and control barrier functions, and solves it with `ProxSuite <https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite>`_.
- **RRT** grows search trees in configuration space, using the ``Scene`` for sampling and collision checks and the vendored `dynotree <https://github.com/quimortiz/dynotree>`_ k-d tree for nearest-neighbor lookups.
- **TOPP-RA** wraps the `toppra <https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra>`_ library to time-parameterize joint paths subject to the velocity and acceleration limits stored in the ``Scene``.
- **CartesianPathPlanner** is the main integration point: it resolves a task-space path into a joint path with an internal OInK solver, then times that path with TOPP-RA.

See the :doc:`Concepts </concepts/index>` section for a detailed description of each algorithm.


Python bindings and visualization
---------------------------------

The bindings are a first-class deliverable (see :doc:`Design Philosophy </design/philosophy>`).
Each package binds its C++ API with `nanobind <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind>`_ and installs typed stubs.

Two modules are implemented in pure Python on top of the bindings:

- ``roboplan.visualization`` renders scenes, paths, and trajectories in the browser using `Viser <https://viser.studio/>`_ (through Pinocchio's ``ViserVisualizer``), and plots trajectories with matplotlib.
- ``roboplan.interpolation`` provides helpers for sampling trajectories and Cartesian paths at arbitrary times.

The Python examples in ``roboplan_examples`` tie everything together: they load a model from ``roboplan.example_models``, build a ``Scene``, run a subset of algorithms, and visualize the results.

.. note::

   Because Pinocchio's Python bindings do not yet use nanobind, the ``Scene``'s C++ Pinocchio model cannot be passed directly to Pinocchio's Python API.
   Visualization therefore builds a separate Pinocchio model on the Python side, loaded from the same URDF as the ``Scene``.
   Pinocchio is actively working on switching its bindings to nanobind; once that lands, the Pinocchio model will be extracted directly from the ``Scene``.


ROS integration
---------------

The core library and all algorithm packages run standalone.
Following the :doc:`Design Philosophy </design/philosophy>`, optional ROS 2 wrappers are maintained in the separate `roboplan-ros <https://github.com/open-planning/roboplan-ros>`_ repository,
which builds on the same standard data types and Python bindings.

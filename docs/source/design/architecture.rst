System Architecture
===================

RoboPlan is organized as a set of packages around a common core.
The core package defines the :doc:`standard data types </design/philosophy>` (e.g., joint information, paths, trajectories) and the ``Scene``, which represents the robot and its environment.
Each algorithm lives in its own package, consumes the ``Scene`` and the standard types, and can be installed and used independently.

The diagram below shows the major components, the external libraries they build on, and how the Python bindings fit in.
Colors indicate the implementation language of each component: C++ only, Python only, or C++ with Python bindings.

Packages
--------

Each C++ package ships its own Python bindings, exposed as a submodule of the ``roboplan`` namespace package.

The core package
----------------

The ``Scene`` is the central object in RoboPlan.
It owns the Pinocchio robot model and data, the collision geometry model, and planning-relevant information such as joint groups, joint limits, and dynamic obstacles.
On top of these it provides the queries every algorithm needs: forward kinematics, frame Jacobians, joint limits and groups, collision and distance checks, random and collision-free sampling, and interpolation/integration that respects the configuration space topology.

Algorithms take a ``Scene`` (usually as a ``std::shared_ptr``) and work with the standard data types, though they can also extract the underlying Pinocchio model information directly from the scene as necessary.
For thread safety, components that check collisions concurrently (such as RRT and OInK) snapshot a private ``CollisionContext`` from the ``Scene`` instead of mutating shared state.
This provides an additional benefit of taking advantage of Pinocchio's broadphase manager for faster collision checking.

The core package also provides post-processing utilities that operate on paths, such as :doc:`path shortcutting </concepts/path_shortcutting>` and uniform resampling.


Algorithm packages
------------------

Each algorithm package builds on the core package, bringing in its own external solver where needed:

- **SimpleIK** iterates a damped least-squares update using Jacobians from the ``Scene``.
- **OInK** formulates IK as a quadratic program over tasks, constraints, and control barrier functions, and solves it with `ProxSuite <https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite>`_.
- **RRT** grows search trees in configuration space, using the ``Scene`` for sampling and collision checks and the vendored `dynotree <https://github.com/quimortiz/dynotree>`_ k-d tree for nearest-neighbor lookups.
- **TOPP-RA** wraps the `toppra <https://github.com/hungpham2511/toppra>`_ library to time-parameterize joint paths subject to the velocity and acceleration limits stored in the ``Scene``.
- **CartesianPathPlanner** is the main integration point: it resolves a task-space path into a joint path with an internal OInK solver, then times that path with TOPP-RA.

See the :doc:`Concepts </concepts/index>` section for a detailed description of each algorithm.


Python bindings and visualization
---------------------------------

The bindings are a first-class deliverable (see :doc:`Design Philosophy </design/philosophy>`).
Each package binds its C++ API with `nanobind <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind>`_ and installs typed stubs, and the per-package modules combine into the single ``roboplan`` namespace package shown in the table above.

Two modules are implemented in pure Python on top of the bindings:

- ``roboplan.visualization`` renders scenes, paths, and trajectories in the browser using `Viser <https://viser.studio/>`_ (through Pinocchio's ``ViserVisualizer``), and plots trajectories with matplotlib.
- ``roboplan.interpolation`` provides helpers for sampling trajectories and Cartesian paths at arbitrary times.

The Python examples in ``roboplan_examples`` tie everything together: they load a model from ``roboplan.example_models``, build a ``Scene``, run a subset of algorithms, and visualize the results.

.. note::

   Because Pinocchio's Python bindings do not yet use nanobind, the ``Scene``'s C++ Pinocchio model cannot be passed directly to Pinocchio's Python API.
   Visualization therefore builds a separate Pinocchio model on the Python side, loaded from the same URDF as the ``Scene``.
   Pinocchio is actively working on switching its bindings to nanobind; once that lands, the Pinocchio model will be extracted directly from the ``Scene``.


ROS integration
---------------

The core library and all algorithm packages run standalone.
Following the :doc:`Design Philosophy </design/philosophy>`, optional ROS 2 wrappers are maintained in the separate `roboplan-ros <https://github.com/open-planning/roboplan-ros>`_ repository,
which builds on the same standard data types and Python bindings.

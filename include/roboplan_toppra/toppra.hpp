  ///   - `SplineFittingMode::Hermite`: Fits a cubic Hermite spline with zero velocity at all

  ///   - `SplineFittingMode::Cubic`: Fits a cubic spline with zero velocity only at the endpoints.

  ///     collision.

  ///     and adds intermediate points if it finds collisions, up to a maximum number of iterations.
  ///     If the path is not collision-free after the maximum iterations, falls back to Hermite

  /// enabled.

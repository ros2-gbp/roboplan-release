# RoboPlan

Modern robot motion planning library based on [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio).

Refer to the [full documentation](https://roboplan.readthedocs.io) for more information.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an experimental repository!
> Until version 1.0 is released, expect some breaking changes.

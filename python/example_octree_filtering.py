"""
Filters the robot's own body out of a point cloud before turning it into an octree.

Points scattered on the Franka at its current pose stand in for a depth camera that also sees
the robot. Unfiltered, they become occupied voxels on the robot body and the current pose is in
collision, so nothing can be planned. Each cycle filters a fresh simulated cloud with
`RobotBodyFilter`, swaps the octree into the scene, and plans RRT to a random goal. Select the
filter with --method; timing is printed for each cycle.
